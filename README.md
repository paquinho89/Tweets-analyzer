# analysis_of_tweets
The objective of this project is to analyze the tweets from any organization, in order to see what's people are talking about it.
The project is diveded in 3 main parts:
- Creation of a map which shows the tweets, the person who writes the tweet and where the tweet comes from.
- Creation of a wordcloud in order to see the most common words and be able to know what people are talking about the organization. This wordcloud will be also done for the hastags
- See the most relevant people who talk about the organization (people with the highest number of followers)

You can check the R file. Please, note that I am currently working in this project and it has not finished yet. I am developing a Shiny app for the final user<br>
