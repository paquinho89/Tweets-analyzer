# analysis_of_tweets
The objective of this project is to analyze the tweets from the company, in order to see what's people are talking about the company.
The project is diveded in 3 main parts:
```Creation of a map which shows the tweet, the person who write the tweet and where the tweet come from.
```Creation of a wordcloud in order to see the most common words and be able to know what people are commenting about the company. This wordcloud will be also done for the hastags
```See the most relevant people who talks about the company (people with the most number of followers)

You can check the R file. Please, note that I am currently working in this project and it has not finished yet.
